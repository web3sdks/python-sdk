# Using Custom Contracts

With the web3sdks SDK, you can get an SDK interface for **any** contract. That's right - the web3sdks SDK doesn't *only* support web3sdks contracts, it supports any contract that you want to use with it and gives you all the convenience of using the web3sdks SDK without the pain of dealing with low level libraries or managing your own ABIs.

Let's take a look at how we can use this functionality!

## Getting a Custom Contract Instance

If you've published and deployed your contracts with the Web3sdks CLI, the process of using custom contracts looks like the following:

```python
# Just pass in the address of your contract and your ready
custom = sdk.get_contract(<CUSTOM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>) 
```

That's it! Now you have a custom contract instance which has the full functionality of your contract (we'll go over how to use this functionality soon).

You've just completely eliminated the need to use ABIs or anything of the sort - the web3sdks SDK and publisher handles all of this for you under the hood.

Alternatively, if you didn't publish your contract with the web3sdks CLI, you can manually pass in your contract ABI to get an interface.

```python
abi = ... # Add or import your contract abi 
contract = sdk.get_contract_from_abi(<CUSTOM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>, abi)
```

### Using Contract Functions

Every custom contract gives you direct access to calling every function on your contract through the `call` method.

All you have to do is pass the name of the function you want to call as the first argument to the `call` method, and then you can pass any arguments to the function right after.

For example, if I had an NFT custom contract and I wanted to make a read-only call to the `balance` function with a token ID of `1`, I would do the following:

```python
# The first argument is the function name, any subsequent arguments are passed to the function
contract.call("balance", 1)
```

Alternatively, if I want to mint an NFT on my custom contract, I would want to use the `mintTo(address, uri)` function. I could do this with the following:

```python
address = "0x..."
uri = "ipfs://..."
contract.call("mintTo", address, uri)
```

Even better, if you're contract implements common interfaces recognized by the web3sdks SDK, we'll give you even nicer convenience functions to make these function calls. For example, let's say my contract implements the `ERC721` interface. If I want to call the `balance` function, I could also do the following:

```python
# ERC721 functions are scoped to the "nft" name space
contract.nft.balance()
```

The benefit of using this is that you all details around how data needs to get prepared and passed into your contracts gets handled for you in our namespaces interface methods, meaning that you don't have to worry about formatting data or making necessary calls before your transactions.

### Supported Interfaces

Below is a list of all the currently supported contract interfaces and their corresponding namespaces:

| Interface      | Namespace |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ContractMetadata     | `custom.metadata` |
| ContractRoles   | `custom.roles` |
| ContractRoyalties   | `custom.royalties` |
| ContractPrimarySales   | `custom.platform_fee` |
| ERC20   | `custom.token` |
| ERC721   | `custom.nft` |
| ERC1155   | `custom.edition` |
